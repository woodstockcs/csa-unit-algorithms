Choose one of the sort algorithms you studied in this unit. Record a short (max 5 minutes) explainer video that shows you demonstrating that sort algorithm on an randomly ordered set of 8 items. Choose items that can easily be identified as having a "correct" order, by whatever metric you choose. For example, books could be sorted by size or title or author name.

Explain what you're doing in the video using either audio narration or readable signs on the screen.

Upload your video to your school youtube account and submit the link in the google classroom assignment.
