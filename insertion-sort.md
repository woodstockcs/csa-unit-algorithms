# Insertion Sort

### Part 1: Instruction
1. Watch the Edhesive video at _Term 2: Lesson 16 - Insertion Sort_ and take notes on your copy of the slides.
1. Read the accompanying text summary to re-inforce your understanding.
1. Answer the Edhesive questions at _Term 2: Lesson 16 - Review Questions_.

### Part 2: Exploration
1. Use the visualizing tools [here](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) to study the difference between Selection Sort and Insertion Sort. You'll have to run those two sorts multiple times in different scenarios.
1. Go outside and make two sketches in the snow or mud. One sketch should be a snapshot of what Insertion Sort looks like when it's halfway done sorting a list that was initial in reverse order, and the other sketch should be the same but for Selection Sort.
1. Take a picture of your sketches and add it to our shared slidedeck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pu9bwrpy0Ow5_Kcx-aGH0bbVfwsG57f8KgYmTqnpqpo/edit?usp=sharing). (no cheating -- don't look at the slidedeck until after you've taken your picture!)
1. Add text to the slide to label each sketch and to display your name.

### Part 3: Mastery Check
1. See Mr. Smith for a mastery check before moving on to the next lesson.
