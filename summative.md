# Unit 7 Summative

### Checklist

To score __Approaching__:
- Successfully complete the mastery checks for 7.1 - 7.3.

Choose items that can easily be identified as having a "correct" order, by whatever metric you choose. For example, books could be sorted by size or title or author name.
- Explain what you're doing in the video using either audio narration or readable signs on the screen.
- Upload your video to your school youtube account (make sure it's not "private").
- Go to the google classroom assignment called "Submit your Unit 7 Summative here" and, well, submit the link to your youtube video there.
