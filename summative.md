# Unit 7 Summative


Choose one of the sort algorithms you studied in this unit. Record a short (max 5 minutes) explainer video that shows you demonstrating that sort algorithm on an randomly ordered set of 8 items. Choose items that can easily be identified as having a "correct" order, by whatever metric you choose. For example, books could be sorted by size or title or author name.

Explain what you're doing in the video using either audio narration or readable signs on the screen.

Upload your video to your school youtube account and submit the link in the google classroom assignment called "Unit 7 Video Project".



Do the Edhesive coding project called _Assignment 6: Sort Team Directory_.

__HOW TO SUBMIT__:

1. Submit your code on the Edhesive platform. You'll be submitting two classes there. Each is worth 5 points.
1. In the google classroom assignment called "Unit 7 Coding Project", submit screenshots showing the scores Edhesive awarded you for those two classes.
